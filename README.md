In the beginning, our team has created Product Recommendation project which put onto
Github, and now we have this maven project on Github.

When finished install Eclipse for Java EE edition, we can click Open Perspective and choose
Git. In this step, what we want to do is Clone a Git repository.
After that, we can clone the project URL,
https://github.com/AgilePrimeFighting/2016Semester2Agile

Then copy and paste it into the location. In this section, select branch master. We are going
to specify the destination location. Choose the directory and finish. Now we have Git
repositories here; the Product Recommendation project is under the Working Tree.

Now you need to have Maven project in your local. In my Project Explorer, choose Import
Existing Maven Projects and find the directory which you save before. We can see the pom
file, so import pom.xml and finish.

When building the project, it required connecting to the tomcat server.

Click project properties, in Project Facets, found tomcat server In runtime section, select
Apache Tomcat, now in the project office, it would work as well. Finally, run the project as
Server. It would show the main website.
